# RegressionModel_ApprenticeChef
Understanding supervised machine learning by implementing regression modelling techniques.
Building a predictive model with a continuous response variable (Y), which in this case is revenue.
Focused on understanding testing and training gaps, response variable usage, model types and model prediction accuracy.
The models focused in this analysis are; OLS model (standard linear regression), Lasso regression, Bayesian Automatic Relevance Determination (ARD) and K-Nearest Neighbors regression (KNN).
